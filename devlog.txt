~~ Chief of Staff's summary of events ~~
- ugh i totally understand Dave I hate it when people steal sweaters off my desk 
- plan things out carefully, making sure to layout the foundation first (action1). This way, you don’t end up with a bridge that is half suspension bridge and half supporting columns.
    - on that note, know which parts of the code are essential and which are for funnies
- make sure program works on all systems (action2). there is no reason why it should be fine on a mac, but break on a linux computer; restarting a computer will not make things work magically!
- enforce and use good coding practices (action3)- do not try to rush through the problem, or use bugs/hacks as acceptable code. communicate to your teammates where there are issues, questionable code, or if you're unsure about anything 
    - if you have a problem with the code and don’t try to resolve it, any code built off it it will turn into a pile of broken snowflakes soaked in cat urine with a Picasso covering it because no one wants to see the mess and no one will want to fix it
    - agree on a set of “standards” with your team before coding, and check up on code often to make sure it complies
- haha 4chan. also gg to the kid in Russia and rip all of our internet privacy
